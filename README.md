# Hello there!

So, this is my challenge for the Aerolab interview, feel free to check what I've been doing in the last few days!
If you want to see what's going on inside this app, you can clone my repo and then:

```sh
cd aerolab-challenge
npm install
npm start
```


And that's it! 

Or you can have a look at [my uploaded app!](https://nodejs.org/)

##See you around! Have a nice day 😁
